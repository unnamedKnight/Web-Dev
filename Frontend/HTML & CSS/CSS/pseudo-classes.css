/*- structural pseudo classes allows us to select things based on where they are on the page */


/* 
- padding allows us to space out the content itself form the background and border
- so we can expand our background as needed

- margin is for spacing out different elements
- Let's say we have two divs and both of them have margins, but margins don't add up
- whichever divs margin has the highest value that margin will take effect


- {
    box-sizing: border-box
}

- This css above will not scale the html element with padding and border externally
- But it will scale the element within the height and width that is provided in the css
